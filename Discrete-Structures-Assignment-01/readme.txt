#QUESTION

Write a program which checks whether T2 is a sub-tree of T1, when
both the trees are represented using adjacency matrix.

#Sample Input to the program
Start the vertices from 0 onwards , if you try to start with 1 it will show Array Index Out of Bound Exception.


ENTER THE INFORMATION FOR THE FIRST TREE
Enter the Number of Vertices in the First Tree:
3
Please enter the order of edges in the tree
Enter the first vertex of the edge1
0
Enter the second vertex of the edge1
1
Enter the first vertex of the edge2
0
Enter the second vertex of the edge2
2
The Adjacency matrix of the First Tree is as follows
0 1 1 
1 0 0 
1 0 0 
Vertex 0 is connected to:1 2 
Vertex 1 is connected to:0 
Vertex 2 is connected to:0 

ENTER THE INFORMATION OF THE SECOND TREE 
Enter the no of vertices in the second tree 
2
enter the first vertex of the edge 1
0
enter the second vertex of the edge 1
1

The Adjacency Matrix of the Second Tree is 
0 1 0 
1 0 0 
0 0 0 
Vertex 0 is connected to:1 
Vertex 1 is connected to:0 
Vertex 2 is connected to:

The Second Tree is a Sub-Tree of the First Tree
